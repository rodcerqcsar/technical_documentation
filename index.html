        <li>(Hidden Door School - Stealth/Survival Combat Art)</li>
        <li>Founder: Daisuke Nishina - 12. century</li>
        <code>戸隠流忍法</code>
        <p>It was founded by Togakure Daisuke who was a vassal of Kiso Yoshinaka when he lost a war and, after
            learning various military arts such as Kosshijutsu, and Kenjutsu from his uncle Kagakure Doshi, was in hiding
            in Iga in the early 12th Century. It was initially called Togakure Ryu Happo Hiken but has been called by
            various names since that time. Iga Ninja such as Momochi Sandayu and others studied the Ryu and they
            passed it to the Natori family of Kishu clan, and later in the 17th Century, to the Toda Family. Togakure Ryu
            is known for it's use of the Shuko, Sendan Nage, Shuriken, 4 feet Shinodake used in Suiren. Togakure Ryu
            Ninpo Taijutsu is a branch of Kosshijutsu</p>
        <p>Togakure utilizes a large array of ninja weapons, including the
            Kosetsu Shogee, shuriken, Shuko/Ashiko hand and foot claws, grappling hooks, etc. The movements in
            Togakure Ryu are very low, stretched out and angular - as opposed to circular movements with small foot base as seen in other arts. It was developed in highly mountainous areas, and its very low stances and long
            range attacks make much more sense when put in the context of that terrain. The strategies employed are
            adapted for survival and escape, such as throws that direct the attacker away, rolling movements, evasion
            and "disappearing" skills, and techniques that incapacitate (sometimes brutally and deceptively). When
            necessary, the emphasis was on escape and spying involving the use of little gadgets, espionage,
            concealment, sabotage, breaking in and escaping, etc. The Sakki Test for the rank of Godan (sensing an
            attack without seeing it) comes from Togakure Ryu </p>

        <li>(Jewel Tiger School - Flesh Attacking Art)</li>
        <li>Founder: Tozawa Hakuunsai - 12. century</li>
        <code>玉虎流骨指術</code>
        <p>Koshijutsu: Attacks against soft parts of the body and muscles. Moves sideways, or around the attack, to get
            close to Kyoshi (the week parts of the body). These targets can be nerve points, but also inner organs, or
            muscles and where the muscles are attached. One of the reasons for this system is probably because it was
            developed by a small person. A frequently used body weapon in Gyokko ryu is the fingers and the fingertips.
            It is important to protect the heart. Therefore a starting position with the right leg forward is preferred, so that
            the left side is turned away from the opponent. </p>
        <p>. Gyokko Ryu Kosshijutsu is the oldest school in the Bujinkan,
            and was probably brought to Japan from China around 618 AD - 907 AD. Gyokko Ryu's movement is suited
            for armored or unarmored combat. It utilizes distancing, circular movements and attacks to detailed functions
            of the body such as muscles and nerves. Typical for the Gyokko Ryu are powerful counter-striking blocks
            that hit with the knuckles and balance-taking. Shitojutsu (use of thumbs and fingers) is at trait of Gyokko Ryu,
            and the many various fist positions used in the Bujinkan come from this school

        <li>(Nine Demons School - Weapons Art)</li>
        <li>Founder: Izumo Koshiro Yoshiteru - 12. century</li>
        <code>九鬼神伝八法秘剣</code>
        <p>The founder was a guard of the Tenno Go-Daigo (Emperor) called Yasushimaru Kurabito Takamasa.
            Because of his excellent contribution as a guard, Yasushimaru was later awarded Kuki family name. The
            Kukishinden style was developed in the Kumano prefecture, and during the life of the school it was employed
            by Japanese seamen for combat. This greatly influenced the schools techniques and weapons. Warriors of
            the Kukishinden are said to have used masts and rigging during combat. In addition to eight techniques such
            as Bojutsu, Yari, Naginata, Shuriken, Taijutsu this Ryu also uses Kenpo (Sword). It excels especially in it's
            use of the sword. At the time, as it was an era of civil wars, sword was mainly used to kill, but as time
            changes and it became more peaceful, sword switched its function to protect good, and punish the bad.
            </p>
        <p>Because the Kuki Suigun (Navy) used swords on ships, the lowered Posture that gave better balance
            became the basic way of sword of this Ryu. This school is most famous in the Bujinkan for its many different
            weapon techniques. It is a complete fighting system and battlefield art based on unarmed fighting, bo, hanbo,
            yari and naginata techniques as well as techniques for throwing projectiles. Techniques are done assuming
            the combatants are wearing armor, and the movements reflect this. Since this system may have been used
            as a naval art, consequently the movements are designed to be used on a ship that is slippery and
            rocking.Sensei Ueshiba, the founder of modern Aikido, in his youth studied the Kukishinden from the Kuki
            family.</p>

        <li>(Immoveable Heart School - Striking/Grappling Art)</li>
        <li>Founder: Izumo Kanja Yoshiteru - 12. century</li>
        <code>神伝不動流打拳体術</code>
        <p>Shinden Fudo Ryu Dakentai Jutsu was founded in the beginning of 1100 by Izumo Kaja Yoshitero. Shindenfudo
            Ryu's jujutsu was one of the arts that contributed to the creation of Kodokan Judo. It is most famous in the
            Bujinkan for the rough Dakentaijutsu striking techniques. It utilizes throws, strikes, locks, and kicks done in a
            fairly straightforward manner. It uses the body as a striking weapon and often appears "hard" in application.</p>
        <p>The Shinden Fudo Ryu emphases the use of nature, and techniques are often very casual-looking. There
            are no formal postures in the school, the kamae are "held in your heart". However most of the techniques
            start from natural standing and sitting postures. One of the secret attributes of Shinden Fudô ryu is the
            "Principle of nature". Shinden Fudo Ryu suits small od weak persons very well. The school is specialized on
            Jujutsu and Iainuki (fast sword drawing). Striking and kicking should be done in blind angles of the opponent.</p>

        <li>Founder: Sasaki Goeman Teruyoshi - 16. century</li>
        <code>玉心流忍法</code>
        <p>It is believed that the techniques of Gyokushin Ryu are based on Gyokko Ryu. In the west, not much is
            known of the combat techniques of Gyokushin Ryu, except that it may have utilized many sacrifice-throws.</p>
        <p>The school specialized in the espionage aspect of Ninjutsu. This school was kept secret and unmixed with
            other schools until it passed to Toda Nobutsuna (1624-1644).</p>
      <section class="main-section" id="Koto_Ryu_Koppojutsu">
        <header>Koto Ryu Koppojutsu</header>
        <li>(Knocking Down Tiger School - Bone/Structure Attacking Art)</li>
        <li>Founder: Chan Buso - 16. century</li>
        <code>虎倒流骨法術</code>
        <p>The exact origin of this school is not known, but it is speculated that the Koto Ryu came to Japan via Korea,
            by Chan Busho, a Chinese warrior. The techniques were organized by Sakagami Taro Kunishige in 1542.
            Koto Ryu uses short distances between opponents, and the techniques are direct and to- the-point. It
            focuses on powerful striking, with power generated from twisting and turning of the hips and shoulders. In
            the Bujinkan, it is renowned for its unarmed techniques that attack the body's structure to take down
            opponents. Distance is created by moving along with the attack, then moving forward with a strike and then
            move quickly out to a safe distance again. This is done to come in with a strike at exactly 90 degrees against
            the bone structure of the attacker to do most damage. To do this demands good timing and rhythm in the
            defensive attack, often done with yoko aruki.</p>
        <p>Another important part of the footwork is to hit the attackers toki
            (the top of the foot), by kicking or stepping on it to control his balance. Starting distance should be really big
            from the start, the attacker must take one big step or several steps to reach the defender. This states clearly
            that Koto Ryu was developed for the battlefield or out doors in general, and not inside a house or narrowed
            places. The Koto Ryu stylist should be looking right between the attackers eyebrows, so that the attacker
            cannot read the intentions through his eyes. The attacker will also believe that he have eye contact, wich will
            be confusing for him in an unusual way. Other typical methods of Koto Ryu is the use of metsubushi,
            different ways of blinding the attacker or attacking the eyes directly.

        <li>Founder: Uryu Hangan Gikanbo - 16. century</li>
        <code>義鑑流骨法術</code>
        <p>The Gikan Ryu Koppojutsu is almost totally unknown today to the public. The founder of Gikan Ryu was Uryu
            Hogan Gikanbo , who lived during the Eiroku Era (1558 - 1570). The Gikan Ryu was heavily influenced by
            Gyokko Ryu Koppojutsu. From the teachings of Gikanbo comes the saying: 'Bufu Ni Sente Nashi (From this
            side will not come the first strike).</p>
        <p>Gikan Ryu Koppojutsu contains special kicks, punches and throws. It is
            said that Gikanbo developed a special punch that could break a sword. Gikan Ryu is known for powerful
            "cross" counterstrikuing, which come from far side of the body to strike, unlike strikes seen in the other
            Bujinkan schools. These strikes, when performed properly, can disable the attacker without further
            confrontation.</p>

        <code>高木揚心流柔體術</code>
        <p>Takagi Yoshin Ryu was often used by ancient Japanese police in close-quartered urban settings to
            apprehend fugitives. It employs grappling and throwing techniques similar to modern day
            Jujitsu/Judo/Aikido. Takagi Yoshin Ryu has a "yielding" feel that reacts to the forces provided by the
            opponent, and uses someone's efforsts against them. Although similar in some ways to Judo/Jujitsu/Aikido,
            Takagi Yoshin Ryu goes further by making it more difficult for the opponent to roll or fall safely. It includes
            techniques for non-lethally ambushing, disarming, and capturing people for questioning.</p>
        <p>Fighting wearing armour and Daisho (long and short sword), and fighting agains oponent wearing armour and Daisho. Takagi
            Yoshin Ryu Jutaijutsu has been handed down together with Kukishinden Ryu for generations.</p>

        <li>Founder: Heinaizaemon Ienaga Iga - 16. century</li>
        <code>雲隠流忍法</code>
        <p>It is introduced by Iga Heinaizaemon Ienaga (Kumogakure Hoshi) who was believed to be the founder of Iga
            Ryu Ninpo. This Ryu was passed to the Toda family by Toda Sagenta Nobufusa. Ninjutsu school of thought,
            centering its techniques on the non-violent side of Ninjutsu. Specialties of this Ryu include the Kamayari (a
            hooked spear), and is known for its tobi-waza (jumping techniques). The hooked spear was originally used
            for climbing up the sides of ships and was also used against swordsmen. </p>
        <p>Also used was the Demon Mask, sometimes worn by the members of the Ryu, for masking their faces, to play on the myth surrounding ninja
            and to scare the enemy. It may be from here that the Kikaku Ken strike ("Demon Horn strike") originated,
            which is rarely seen in other arts. When going into battle, ninja of this Ryu wore armored sleeves to protect
            themselves. Kumogakure Ryu also taught various survival techniques such as making fire in wet weather. It
            is said that the phrase "Shikin Haramitsu Daikomyo", which is said during the Bujinkan bowing procedure,
            comes from this Ryu and reflects both Buddhist and Shinto attitudes</p>
